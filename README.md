# The Hedgehog Den Chronicles — A Narrative-Driven Java Multithreading Simulation

A hedgehog-themed, folklore-spiced multithreading simulation modeled as a coherent miniature world, where a verifiable technical demonstration meets configurable randomness, narrative logging, and a dramatic model of resource management, conflict, and survival.

## Background

This project was originally a university assignment in a Java Multithreading course, where the requirements were rather broad: build a threaded system in which every entity competing for a shared resource is itself a thread, organize the code using meaningful packages, apply the Singleton pattern, synchronize access through a monitor, and implement structured logging throughout. Beyond this minimal framework, the task provided no domain, no model, and no guidance on how the system should behave or how its correctness should be verified, leaving all architectural decisions—thread interactions, resource-allocation logic, internal rules, and especially the mechanisms ensuring consistent, checkable results in a concurrent environment—to be designed and implemented entirely by me.

## Why This Project Is Here

Although this simulation was written for a Java Multithreading course, its value in my portfolio is not about Java itself. The assignment provided almost no domain or structure, so the entire model—its rules, events, verification mechanisms, and internal logic—had to be designed from scratch. This project demonstrates my ability to turn vague requirements into a coherent system, build reproducible behavior in a concurrent environment, and design a simulation with meaningful counters, logs, and configuration options.

## How to Run

This is a standard Maven project written with **Java 21**.  
To start the simulation, simply run the `Main` class.

- All parameters (timings, probabilities, feature toggles) are configured in `config/ConfigParameters.java`.
- Simulation logs are written automatically to the `logs/` directory.

## How It Works

The Hedgehog Den Chronicles is a Java-based multithreaded simulation where different types of threads interact with a shared resource pool — the hedgehog population. Various events are modeled using individual threads, synchronized through a single lock and multiple condition variables.

## Key Features

**Configurable Parameters:** Most simulation behavior, probabilities, and timing can be adjusted in `config/ConfigParameters.java`. The config class also includes feature toggles for every type of event.

**Thread Types:** Each event is represented by its own independent thread — mating, parasitic ticks, epidemiologists, fairy-induced war, and hungry bums.

**Narrative Logs:** Story-like log files illustrating events in the colony.

**Detailed Stats:** Multiple counters track population changes, lock contention, condition waits, and other metrics, with key stats displayed live during the simulation.

## The World: Event Types

**Tick Outbreak:** A burst of short-lived threads that adds an initial wave of ticks to the population, stress-testing the monitor and seeding the simulation with parasites.

**Casual Ticks:** Persistent threads that periodically add ticks one by one, slowly increasing the parasite load.

**Epidemiologists:** Scientists who select hedgehogs with enough ticks and remove all parasites from them.

**Hungry Bums:** Wandering figures who occasionally devour unsuspecting hedgehogs, permanently removing them from the population.

**Mating:** Threads that reserve a male and a female hedgehog to produce a new hedgehog added to the colony.

**Fairies & War:** Fairies that abduct hedgehogs for war, preferring seasoned warriors, then males, then anyone. A hedgehog may die, return unchanged, or gain a seasoned-warrior level that increases future survival.

## Configuration Overview

All simulation settings are defined in `config/ConfigParameters.java`. The class centralizes every adjustable aspect of the simulation, including:

- Overall simulation duration and initial population size
- Feature toggles controlling which event types are enabled
- Probabilities governing outcomes of events
- Timing parameters for each thread type (average delays and task sleep ranges)
- Monitoring and display frequencies for live statistics

All parameters are static and read at startup, so modifying this file is the only action required to tune the model’s behavior.

---

## Limitations

- The maximum number of hedgehogs is currently limited by name pool size.
- The simulation is self-contained and not intended for user interaction beyond startup. It will end either after a configurable amount of time or as soon as all hedgehogs die — whichever happens first.

*No hedgehogs were harmed in the making of this simulation.*
